Healthy lifestyles are trending today. Diets and physical training are the basis of healthy lifestyle. Analysis of data about the physiological state of a person and his activity can be used to improve the efficiency of diet\training programs. For this purpose, we are trying to estimate heart rate (HR) and intensity of activity from data measured with fit-bit wearable device. We found that the most successful model of HR estimation that we created was achieved by SVM regression for each individual person in the study (highest success rate of 72% for 5BPM error margin). Individuals with more measurements lead to better results. We believe that finding the optimal time frame for data collection will improve the results significantly. As people's normal physiological state changes over time due to many things (e.g., aging, disease, and the results of the dieting and activity as well) we need to update the model occasionally.
